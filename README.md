# Cruz Cycles

This project detects chains of synonyms that terminate on an antonym of the source word. For instance, the following cycle begins with a source ("thoughtful") and ends an antonym of the source ("heedless"), connected through a chain of synonyms:

```
thoughtful, serious, sincere, artless, careless, heedless
```
